# About 
The client for this project is DriverPass. They wanted a system that provided driver training for their customers through online classes and practice tests. They also want the system to support the ability for customers to opt-in for on-the-road training through a driving lesson reservation system. 

# What did I do particularly well?
Breaking down the use cases or functionalities of the system and presenting them to the client in a non-technical manner. 

# How did I interpret the user’s needs and implement them into my system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpretted the user's needs by transfering them into use cases, and then detailing them in the Business Requirements Document and UML diagrams. It is so important to consider the user's needs when designing, because the system exists to serve its user's wants and needs. Designing a system that does not meet its direct users' needs is a waste of resources. 

# How do I approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would I use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by, first, understanding the client's needs and wants for the software. Then, I break these customer requirements down into functional and nonfunctional requirements. The techniques or strategies that I would use in the future to analyze and design a system are breaking the use cases into different UML diagrams to better depict the system's different functionalities.
